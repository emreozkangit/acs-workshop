[#network_graph_overview]
== Network Graph Overview

The Network Graph is a flow diagram, firewall diagram, and firewall rule builder in one.

In the upper left you’ll see the dropdown for clusters so I can easily navigate between any of the clusters that are connected to ACS.

* The default view, Active, shows me actual traffic for the Past Hour between the deployments in all of the namespaces.

You can change the time frame in the upper right dropdown, and the legend at bottom left

* Zoom in on Payments Namespace

As we zoom in, the namespace boxes show the individual deployment names

* Click on ```api-server``` deployment.

* Clicking on a deployment brings up details of the types of traffic observed including source or destination and ports.

[#network_graph_views]
== Network Graph Views

In the Network Graph view, you can configure the type of connections you want to see. In the Flows section (upper left), select:

* **Active** to view only active connections.
* **Allowed** to view only allowed network connections.
* **All** to view both active and allowed network connections.

* Let’s switch the view from active connections to the firewall view - Allowed.

This allows us to quickly see the disconnect between what we’ve actually seen happening, versus the wide-open view we see here

The red dots indicate an unrestricted deployment that is an open network.

The dashed lines indicate a namespace with no restrictions on egress and in conflict with best practices required under several compliance standards.

[#network_policy_simulator]
== Network Policy Simulator

* Click on Network Policy Simulator button in the top right

The Network Policy Simulator is designed to help solve this problem by using the history of observed traffic to build firewall rules.
Click on Generate and Simulate

You’ll notice, though, that the firewall rules we’re generating are not proprietary rules, but OpenShift-native Network Policy objects.
This feature, more than any other, illustrates the philosophy that ACS represents: Security through platform-native features, with fixes supplied as configuration for OpenShift.

By implementing stronger security through declarative code we believe this avoids the anti-pattern of having configuration rules in a separate system - this code becomes part of your application, ensuring the consistency of “single source of truth” from your codebase.

This approach also reduces operational risk since there is no proprietary firewall in your cluster or in your pods that could fail, causing an application outage.
ACS is leveraging the firewall that’s already in your OpenShift cluster.

You’ll see this approach - “fix it in the code,” “leverage the platform,” - everywhere throughout the product - and we’ll take a look at what those policies look like, with examples of policy violations.
