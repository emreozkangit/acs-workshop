NOTE: In RHACS the Scanner component only scans those images that are not already scanned by other integrated vulnerability scanners. It means that if you have integrated Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes with other vulnerability scanners, Scanner checks and uses the scanning results from the integrated scanner if available.

[#integrate_acs_oauth]
== Integrate ACS with OpenShift OAuth

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) Central is installed with one administrator user by default. Typically, customers request an integration with existing Identity Provider(s) (IDP). 

RHACS offers different options for such integration. In this section we will see the integration with OpenShift OAuth.

NOTE: It is assumed that RHACS is already installed and login to the Central UI is available. 

. Login to your RHACS and select “Platform Configuration” > “Access Control”
+
image::integrations/01-oauth.png[OAuth 1, 400]

. From the drop down menu Add auth provider select OpenShift Auth
+
image::integrations/02-oauth.png[OAuth 2, 200]

. Enter a Name for your provider and select a default role which is assigned to any user who can authenticate.
It is recommended to select the role None, so new accounts will have no privileges in RHACS.
With Rules you can assign roles to specific users, based on their userid, name, mail address or groups.
For example the user with the name admin gets the role Admin assigned. On the other hand the user1 will have the role of Read-Only Analyst.

[#integrate_acs_webhook]
== Integrate ACS with Webhook for Audit

With Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes, you can send alert notifications as JSON messages to any webhook receiver. When a violation occurs, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes makes an HTTP POST request on the configured URL. The POST request body includes JSON-formatted information about the alert.

The webhook POST request’s JSON data includes a v1.Alert object and any custom fields that you configure, as shown in the following example:

[.console-input]
[source,json,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
{
  "alert": {
    "id": "<id>",
    "time": "<timestamp>",
    "policy": {
      "name": "<name>",
      ...
    },
    ...
  },
  "<custom_field_1>": "<custom_value_1>"
}
----

In this section, we will integrate example webhook for audit logs.
