NOTE: In RHACS the Scanner component only scans those images that are not already scanned by other integrated vulnerability scanners. It means that if you have integrated Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes with other vulnerability scanners, Scanner checks and uses the scanning results from the integrated scanner if available.

[#integrate_acs_oauth]
== Integrate ACS with OpenShift OAuth

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) Central is installed with one administrator user by default. Typically, customers request an integration with existing Identity Provider(s) (IDP). 

RHACS offers different options for such integration. In this section we will see the integration with OpenShift OAuth.

NOTE: It is assumed that RHACS is already installed and login to the Central UI is available. 

. Login to your RHACS and select “Platform Configuration” > “Access Control”
+
image::integrations/01-oauth.png[OAuth 1, 400]

. From the drop down menu Add auth provider select OpenShift Auth
+
image::integrations/02-oauth.png[OAuth 2, 200]

. Enter a Name for your provider and select a default role which is assigned to any user who can authenticate.
It is recommended to select the role None, so new accounts will have no privileges in RHACS.
With Rules you can assign roles to specific users, based on their userid, name, mail address or groups.
For example the user with the name admin gets the role Admin assigned. On the other hand the user1 will have the role of Continuous Integration.
+
image::integrations/03-oauth.png[OAuth 3, 800]

. After Save the integration will appear as Auth Provider
+
image::integrations/04-oauth.png[OAuth 4, 800]

. In a private windows of your browser login into the RH ACS portal, and check the OpenShift OAuth auth provider that you set up
+
image::integrations/05-oauth.png[OAuth 5, 400]

. Login first with the opentlc-mgr user
+
image::integrations/06-oauth.png[OAuth 6, 400]

. opentlc-mgr user will have the role Admin in RH ACS, so will have full privileges in the ACS console. Check that you have full view of the Violations or Compliance among others.
+
image::integrations/07-oauth.png[OAuth 7, 700]

. Logout and login again but this time with the user user1 instead
+
image::integrations/08-oauth.png[OAuth 8, 500]

. This user have read-only privileges and for example cannot edit the Policy or etc in the cluster 
+

[#integrate_acs_sso]
== Integrate ACS with Red Hat Single Sign On

The following steps will create some basic example objects to an existing RHSSO or Keycloak to test the authentication at RHACS.

. Create the namespace for the single-sign-on
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
oc new-project single-sign-on
----

. Create the OperatorGroup for install the RHSSO operator
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  annotations:
    olm.providedAPIs: Keycloak.v1alpha1.keycloak.org,KeycloakBackup.v1alpha1.keycloak.org,KeycloakClient.v1alpha1.keycloak.org,KeycloakRealm.v1alpha1.keycloak.org,KeycloakUser.v1alpha1.keycloak.org
  generateName: single-sign-on
  name: single-sign-on
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
    - single-sign-on
----
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
oc apply -f sso-og.yaml
----

. Create the Subscription Operator for the RHSSO
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: rhsso-operator

  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
----
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
oc apply -f sso-subs.yaml
----

. Create an instance of Keycloak
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----
apiVersion: keycloak.org/v1alpha1
kind: Keycloak
metadata:
  name: rhacs-keycloak
  namespace: single-sign-on
spec:
  externalAccess:
    enabled: true
  instances: 1
----
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----
oc apply -f sso-instance.yaml
----

. Create the Realm for the installation called **Basic**
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----
apiVersion: keycloak.org/v1alpha1
kind: KeycloakRealm
metadata:
 name: rhacs-keycloakrealm
 namespace: single-sign-on
spec:
 instanceSelector:
   matchLabels:
     app: sso
 realm:
   displayName: Basic Realm
   enabled: true
   id: basic
   realm: basic
----
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----
oc apply -f sso-realm.yaml
----

. Login into Red Hat SSO. Get the route to your RHSSO instance and log into the Administration Interface.
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----
oc get route keycloak -n single-sign-on --template='{{ .spec.host }}'
----

. Extract the admin password for Keycloak. The secret name is build from "credential"<keycloak-instance-name>
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----
oc extract secret/credential-rhacs-keycloak -n single-sign-on --to=-
----
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----
# ADMIN_PASSWORD
<you password>
# ADMIN_USERNAME
admin
----

. Be sure to select your Realm (Basic in our case), goto Clients and select a ClientID and enable the option Implicit Flow
+
image::integrations/01-sso.png[SSO 1, 800]

. Get the Issuer URL from your realm. This is typically your:
+
image::integrations/02-sso.png[SSO 2, 800]
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----
https://<KEYCLOAK_URL>/auth/realms/<REALM_NAME>;
----

. It's time to Create Test Users to login! 
In RHSSO create 2 user accounts to test the authentication later. Goto Users and create the users:
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----
User: acsadmin
First Name: acsadmin
----
+
image::integrations/04-sso.png[SSO 3, 800]
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----
User: user1
First Name: user 1
----
+
You can set any other values for these users. However, be sure to set a password for both, after they have been created.


. To configure RHACS Authentication: RHSS, login to your RHACS and select “Platform Configuration” > “Access Control”
+
image::integrations/03-sso.png[SSO 3, 800]

* Enter a “Name” for your provider i.e. “Single Sign On”
* Leave the “Callback Mode” to the “Auto-Select” setting
* Enter your Issuer URL
* As Client ID enter account (or the ClientID you would like to use)
* Leave the Client Secret empty and select the checkbox Do not use Client Secret which is good enough for our tests.
* Remember the two callback URL from the blue box. They must be configured in Keycloak.
* Select a default role which is assigned to any user who can authenticate.
* It is recommended to select the role None, so new accounts will have no privileges in RHACS.

. With Rules you can assign roles to specific users, based on their userid, name, mail address or groups.
+
image::integrations/05-sso.png[SSO 5, 800]
+
For example the user with the name admin (which have been created previously in our RHSSO) gets the role Admin assigned.

. What is left to do is the configuration of redirect URLs. These URLs are shown in the ACS Authentication Provider configuration (see blue field in the image above)
+
image::integrations/06-sso.png[SSO 6, 800]

. Log back into RHSSO and select “Clients” > “account”

. Into Valid Redirect URLs enter the two URLs which you saved from the blue box in the RHACS configuration.
+
image::integrations/07-sso.png[SSO 7, 800]

. Verify Authentication with OpenShift Auth. 

. Logout from the Central UI and reload the browser.

. Select from the drop down Single Sign On
+
image::integrations/08-sso.png[SSO 8, 800]

. Try to login with a valid SSO user.
Depending on the Rules which have been defined during previous steps the appropriate permissions should be assigned.
+
For example: If you login as user acsadmin the role Admin is assigned.
